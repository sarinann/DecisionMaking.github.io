            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Occupancy Grid Mapping is used in probabilistic robotics to address the 
                problem of creating maps from noisy and uncertain sensor measurement data.
                This involves assuming that the pose of the robot is known. It was first introduced 
                by H. Moravec and A. Elfes in 1985. As explained by Alberto Elfes in his paper, "The Occupancy Grid
                is a multi-dimensional randomfield model that maintains probabilistic estimates of the occupancy state of each cell in
                a spatia/lattice". Occupancy grid maps are a type of map representation used primarily for mapping and representing the 
                static environment of a robot or an autonomous system. These maps provide information about whether individual cells in a 
                grid are occupied or unoccupied.

            <h2>Occupancy grid mapping in today's robotics</h2>
            <p>Occupancy Grid Maps play a crucial role in enabling robots to understand and navigate within their surroundings. Most of the robotic 
                applications do not come with the luxury of having pre-existing maps that determine the shape of the environment. Building autonomous 
                robots involve the challenge for learning to map from scratch and adapt to the changes with minimal human intervention. 
                Occupancy grid maps will be advantageous for robotics applications in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Robots use occupancy grid maps to represent the environment in a 
                    grid-based format. The environment is discretized into small cells, 
                    and each cell stores information about whether it's occupied by an 
                    obstacle, free space, or unknown. </li>
                <li> Occupancy Grid Mapping algorithms integrate data from sensors attached 
                    onto the robts into the grid cells, updating their occupancy 
                    probabilities based on sensor measurements.</li>
                <li> SLAM is a critical problem in robotics, where a robot must create 
                    a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously localizing itself 
                    within that environment. The robot updates the grid map as it moves 
                    through the environment and simultaneously refines its 
                    estimate of its own position</li>
            </ul>
