            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Occupancy Grid Mapping is used in probabilistic robotics to address the 
                problem of creating maps from noisy and uncertain sensor measurement data.
                This involves the assumption that the pose of the robot is known. It was first introduced 
                by H. Moravec and A. Elfes in 1985. As explained by Alberto Elfes in his paper, "The Occupancy Grid
                is a multi-dimensional randomfield model that maintains probabilistic estimates of the occupancy state of each cell in
                a spatia/lattice". <br> Occupancy grid maps are a type of representation used primarily for mapping and representing the 
                static environment of a robot or an autonomous system. These maps provide information about whether individual cells in a 
                grid are occupied or unoccupied. Information about the environment can be collected from sensors like Lidar, Ultrasonic and sonar sensors, cameras, depth and RGB-D cameras and bump sensors. 
                The data from the sensors can be loaded in ral-time or fed in advance.

            <h2>Occupancy grid mapping in today's robotics</h2>
            <p>Occupancy Grid Maps play a crucial role in enabling robots to understand and navigate within their surroundings. Most of the robotic 
                applications do not come with the luxury of having pre-existing maps that determine the shape of the environment. Building autonomous 
                robots involve the challenge for learning to map from scratch and adapt to the changes with minimal human intervention. 
                Occupancy grid maps will be advantageous for robotics applications in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Robots use occupancy grid maps to represent the environment in a 
                    grid-based format. The environment is discretized into small cells, 
                    and each cell stores information about whether it's occupied by an 
                    obstacle, free space, or unknown. </li>
                <li> Occupancy Grid Mapping algorithms integrate data from sensors attached 
                    onto the robts into the grid cells, updating their occupancy 
                    probabilities based on sensor measurements.</li>
                <li> SLAM is a critical problem in robotics, where a robot must create 
                    a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously localizing itself 
                    within that environment. The robot updates the grid map as it moves 
                    through the environment and simultaneously refines its 
                    estimate of its own position</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>As in any problem of mapping, creating occupancy grid maps also need a state and a measurement model. The state is
                the map of the world which we are trying to find. The measurement model is p(z<sub>t</sub>|m; l<sub>t</sub>>), or the probability of making an
                observation z<sub>t</sub> given a map m and a location on the map l<sub>t</sub>>.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of Occupancy Mapping</h2>
            <p>Since mapping using occupancy grids maps rely on dividing the area into a grid of cells, the level of discretization can heavily influence 
                the map's accuracy and computational resources. Fine-grained grids require more memory, while coarse grids might not capture intricate details in the environment. <br>
                Occupancy grid maps involve an inherent assumption that environment is static which makes it difficult to handle dynamic objects or situations, such as moving obstacles 
                and traffic. <br> Classical occupancy grids also have trouble dealing with semi-transparent obstacles such as glass and vegetation. 
                These obstacles may return hits to the laser rangfinnder about half of the time, but eventually the occupancy grid will converge to either filled 
                or not filled, both of which are incorrect. <br>
                Occupancy grids created through sensors like ultrasonic sensosr often face an issue of speculiarity. This occurs when the sensory beam hits a smooth surface and 
                is reflected off that surface at an obtuse angle. This results in either no or an erroneous reading 
                being returned to the emitter unit. This creates uncertainty in the mapping process which is further influenced by the existence 
                of potentially redundant information. When the robot is in the same pose for a long period of time, the  sensors report multiple readings.
